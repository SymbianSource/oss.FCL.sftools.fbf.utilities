fbf_churn.pl - simple script for calculating code churn in between two revisions 
or labels for a package. This script can also be used to calculate code size for 
a package.

When used without a package name or filter, this script runs for all the packages
in the BOM (build-info.xml) file supplied to it. 

Important: 
  This script uses clone_all_packages.pl which clones all repositories listed in 
  the BOM or pull changes into a previously cloned repository.
  
  This script uses its accompayning script churn_core.pl - which should be
  present in the same directory as this script.

Limitations:
  If a BOM is not supplied to the script using the -bom option, then the script 
  runs on the package locations inside both MCL and FCL producing two results
  for a single package. For running the script for calculating code churn between 
  two release buils (using labels) or for calculating code size for a release build,
  it is essential that a BOM (preferably for the newer build) is passed as an 
  argument using the -bom option.
  

Options:

-o --old		old revision or label for a package/respoitory

-n --new		new revision or label for a package/respoitory

--rev			revision for package/respoitory - Use this while calculating code size for a single package
			
--label			revision tag for package or release build - Use this while calculating code size

-bom --bom		build-info.xml files supplied with Symbian PDKs

-verbose		print the underlying "clone_all_packages" & "hg" commands before executing them

-help			print this help information

-package <RE>   	only process repositories matching regular expression <RE>

-filter <RE>    	only process repositories matching regular expression <RE>
