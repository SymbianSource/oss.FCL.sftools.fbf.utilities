== FCLs ==

This PDK was built using FCL versions of the packages listed below: for each one we list allthe changes in the FCL which are not in the MCL.

The previous PDK also involved some FCLs, so we indicate which FCLs are new to this build.

Cloning the source from Mercurial is made more awkward by using a mixture of MCLs and FCLs, but we provide a tool to help - see [[How to build the Platform]] for details.
