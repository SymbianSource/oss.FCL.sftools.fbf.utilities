hg blacklist 

manage repository changeset blacklist
  
  This extension is used to manage a blacklist for the repository.
  Can blacklist changesets by changeset id, and regular expressions against
  the user field of a changeset and also a changesets file list.
  
  Current rules can be viewed using the [-l|--list] operation.
  
  Each modification to a blacklist is logged. These can be viewed using the 
  --auditlog operation.
  
  Each time a changeset is blocked/denied it's logged. These can be viewed
  using the --blocklog operation.
  
  Types of changeset blacklist rules can be defined implicitly or explicitly:
  
    If a rule definition contains between 12 and 40 hexadecimal characters 
    it is assumed to be a rule matched against changeset id. Can be set 
    explicitly set with the -n flag to the --add operation.
  
    If a rule definition contains a '@' it is assumed to be a rule matched 
    against a changeset's user property. Can be set explicitly with 
    the -u flag to the --add operation.
  
    Otherwise the rule is assumed to be matched against a changeset's file 
    list. Can be set explicitly with the -f flag to the --add operation.
  
    When this extension is enabled a hook is also added to the 
    'pretxnchangegroup' action that will block any incoming changesets 
    (via pull/push/unbundle) if they are blacklisted.
    It won't block any local commits.
